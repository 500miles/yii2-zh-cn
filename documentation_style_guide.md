# Yii 文档风格指南

编写或修改 Yii 文档时的指导方针。

*This needs to be expanded.*

## 通用风格 General Style

* Try to use an active voice.
* Use short, declarative sentences.
* Demonstrate ideas using code as much as possible.
* Never use "we". It's the Yii development team or the Yii core team. Better yet to put things in terms of the framework or the guide.
* Use the Oxford comma (e.g., "this, that, and the other" not "this, that and the other").
* Numeric lists should be complete sentences that end with periods (or other punctuation).
* Bullet lists should be fragments that don't end with periods.

## 排版 Formatting

## 参考文献 References

* Yii 2.0 or Yii 2 (not Yii2 or Yii2.0)
* Each "page" of the guide is referred to as a "section".

## 大小写 Capitalizations

* `Web`，而不是 `web`
* `the guide` 或 `this guide` 而不是 `the Guide`
